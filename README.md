# TvShowApp
Developed a responsive web app that fetches and displays popular TV shows in a card grid layout using the TheMovieDB API. Implemented a search functionality and the ability to favorite shows with the use of React Context API and localStorage. Designed navigation for switching between home and favorites page seamlessly via a navigation bar. I followed a coding tutorial named "Learn React With This ONE Project" by Tech With Tim. The video was a tutorial for how to make a movie app instead of the TV Show app I created. I tweaked the code he provided and the api calls to make the same application but with TV Shows instead of movies.
